*Current*
* loadArray
 ** fix classpath + efficiency
 ** return [(â€¦)], not Map?
 ** efficiency?
* handle exceptions
 ** does it return the same error after the error happened?
* establish some basic integraion testing
* make printing Runtime better
* review class loading implementation
 

*Long term*
* Runtime data structures [**Done**]
* Loading
 ** Symtable, 2 cases [**In progress**]
 ** Deriving class [**In progress**]
 ** Top level class loading [**In progress**]
 ** Test these parts of loading
 ** Change type of class loading status type
* Linking, initializing: light version [**In progress**]
* Executing instructions
* All features skipped
 ** verification
 ** exceptions
 ** synchronization
 ** invokedynamic
 ** multiple threads (use haskell threads and transactions for shared memory?)
 ** user derined class loaders (only boostrap)
* User classpath suport
* Improve class path handling
 ** simpler zip condition - check file signature?
 ** .class files in path
 ** zip, ear, war files in classpath
 ** rename JarFile to ZipFile
 ** recursibe Zip files
 ** common code with statistics?
 ** use vector for bytecodes

*notes*
runtime constant pool must be map
	- not all indices are referenced, see definition of deriveRef - empty results there
SpecifyMeError - replace with detailed, maybe use LinkageError; add messages
VMError and contents: add messages
VMError: use interfaces, less data types? not sure
error is per thread!



- why check not already asked by initCL, but then fail?
- how can be loaded multiple times? different init CLs?
- why runtime package? different initCL !=> different defining CL?


*Possible offspring projects*
* Continue with implenenting garbage collection
* Continue with JIT
* Viewing step by step bytecode execution interactively
* Decompiler
* UI for viewing bytecode
* Disassembler
